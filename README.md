# Ansible Ubuntu Devbox

This is a basic role that I use to quickly spin up an Ubtuntu based server
configured with my preferred user environment and collection of tools which
I use for web development.

While this role is likely not well suited to just anyone, it could be handy
for learning a bit about some of the basic features of Ansible as it does
not use any of Ansible's more advanced features.
